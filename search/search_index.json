Bug Report Change Request Feature Request Bug Report When submitting a bug report, providing us with as much information as possible helps us to identify the root of the problem and fix it as fast as possible. Ideally, we would need the following details: Bug Description: A description of what exactly happened, where it happened and under which circumstances. Provide as many details as possible. Steps to Reproduce: If possible, provide a step-by-step instruction on the order of actions you performed before the bug occurred. This helps us to reproduce it on our system. Expected Behavior: Quickly describe what you believe should've happened instead of the error you got. Screenshots: If possible, make at least one screenshot of the bug and include it in your bug report. You can do this by simply dragging-and-dropping the image file into the template you're filling out. System Details: Tell us which device you were using, on which SORMAS version the error occurred and, depending on whether you were using the mobile app or the web app, your Android version or the web browser. Additional Information: If there is anything else you want to add to your request, you can put it here. Change Request When submitting a change request or a feature request, describing the feature you would like us to add or change in detail will make sure that we have an easier time to discuss it internally and get back to you as quickly as possible. Feature Description: Please describe the feature you would like us to change as it is in SORMAS right now so we know the subject of the issue. Problem Description: Tell us why you want us to change the feature and what you believe is wrong with the way it's currently designed. Proposed Change: Describe in as much detail as possible how you would like us to change the feature. Possible Alternatives: If possible, provide alternative solutions in case your proposed change can not be implemented for any reason. Additional Information: If there is anything else you want to add to your request, you can put it here. Feature Request When submitting a change request or a feature request, describing the feature you would like us to add or change in detail will make sure that we have an easier time to discuss it internally and get back to you as quickly as possible. Situation Description: Please describe why your proposed feature is required and how exactly SORMAS is not able to do what you want it to do right now. Feature Description: Describe in as much detail as possible how your proposed feature should look like and what it should do. Possible Alternatives: If possible, provide alternative solutions in case your proposed feature can not be implemented in the way you outlined it for any reason. Additional Information: If there is anything else you want to add to your request, you can put it here. Contributing to the Project Even as a non-developer, there are a lot of things that you can help us with. If there is something you would like to do that you don't find instructions about here, make sure to contact us at sormas@helmholtz-hzi.de and let us know how we can assist you! Translating SORMAS Defining new diseases Contributing to the Code If you're interested in participating in the development of SORMAS, you can use the following guides to get started. If you have problems setting up your development environment or don't know what you can work on, don't hesitate to contact us at sormas@helmholtz-hzi.de! Setting up your local environment Adding license headers How to add a new disease? How to add a new field? Development Contributing Guidelines Use the eclipse code formatter (Ctrl+Shift+F) and the Android Studio code formatter for the sormas-app project. To not forget this, use save actions for your IDE . Rules for blank lines (which cannot be enforced by automatic formatting): Use one blank line after method definition (but usually not for one liners like getters/setters or delegation). Use one blank line to separate statements within a code block from each other when you start a new logical block. Do not use blank lines after each statement. No blank line after last statement of a block, but closing } with proper intendation in the next line. No blank line between two closing }. You can use //@formatter:off and //@formatter:on to encapsulate a code block where the automated formatting messes up the readability. Try to use this rarely and use proper intendation nevertheless. Rules for code comments: Separate code and comment: Set the comment before the statement(s) you want to explain. Each commit should be related to a single issue on Github and have a reference to this issue as well as a short description on what has been done in this commit: 61 - added model to define classification, apply automatic case classification whenever a field value changes Each pull request should be related to a single issue (if possible). SORMAS Product Backlog The board Product Backlog is used to plan, refine and prioritize the tickets for the upcoming sprints. The sorting from top to bottom in every column reflects the priority for the product. The Product Owner is responsible to put tickets into the Backlog and keep the ticket information updated. The Product Backlog contains the following columns: * Backlog: Issues that have been identified by the Product Owner to be done in the next sprints. There can be a column for each Scrum Team if it fits the need. * Sprint n: Contain tickets picked by the Product Owner to be done in the named sprint. Text notes or separate columns are used to separate issues between Scrum Teams. It gives a forecast what might come in the upcoming sprint and it is the starting point for the Sprint Planning. Every ticket the Development Team do not pick into their Sprint Backlog needs to be moved back to the Backlog column or one sprint further. * Done: Tickets that are closed (usually resolved within the running sprint) are moved here automatically . The sorting does not represent the priority here any more. SORMAS Sprint Backlog The board Sprint Backlog exists for each Scrum Team and is segmented into the following categories: Backlog: Issues that have been selected by the Development Team to be done in the current sprint, but for which work has not yet started. The sorting top to bottom on this column reflects the priority given by the Product Owner at the time of the Sprint Planning. In Progress: Issues that have been assigned to a contributor and for which work has started. Waiting: Issues for which work has started and that have been put on hold, e.g. because action or feedback by an external contributor is required. Review: Issues that have been resolved, but not been reviewed by another contributor yet. The ticket status is usually Open , but Closed is also allowed if no code change or merge is needed. Testing: Issues that have been reviewed and merged to development branch to be tested and verified on a central TEST instance. The ticket status is supposed to be Closed . Done: Issues that have been resolved, reviewed and satisfy the Definition of Done. The ticket status is supposed to be Closed . The general workflow is that whenever a contributor starts working on an issue, they assign themselves to it and manually move the issue from Backlog to In Progress . Transitions to Waiting and Review also need to be done manually. When the developer is done with all work (no code changes or merges needed, milestone is set), the ticket is supposed to be closed to go automatically to Testing . Approved tickets are supposed to be moved manually from Testing to * Done . The GitHub project has been configured to automatically move issues that are closed to Testing and issues that are reopened back to In Progress . The Development Team is responsible to keep the tickets up to date on this board and to assign the appropriate milestone in which the work is going to be released. Managing dependencies For managing Java libraries as dependencies, they are managed by Maven and listed in sormas-base/pom.xml . The purpose of a centralized management is to have an overview of the used libraries and adjust for new versions. Payara modules : Provided by Payara in {payara-home}/glassfish/modules and used in that version by other libs. Domain libs : Provided in Payara domain under {payara-domain}/lib to be usable by deployed artifacts (ear, war). They have to be listed in sormas-base/dependencies/serverlibs.pom . Usually for helper libraries that several artifacts need. Compile dependencies : Bundled in respective artifacts who need the dependency explicitly. Usually for dependencies singularly needed in one artifact. Test libraries : Libraries used in automated tests in one or more modules. Due to the separate build management tool Gradle for sormas-app , there exists a redundant listing of compile dependencies in sormas-app/app/build.gradle . Eclipse Troubleshooting Unfortunatley, when using eclipse together with the Payara Tools, there are a number of deployment problems that you might run into. Examples of these include: ClassDefNotFoundExceptions after deploying the artifacts and logging in to the web app Error messages in eclipse telling you that the deployment failed There are a couple of things you can do to fix these problems: Do a Maven update for all projects Stop and restart the server Re-deploy the server artifacts If the problem occurred right after you've pulled new code from GitHub, your safest bet is probably to start with the Maven update. For most other problems, a simple re-deployment or, if necessary, server restart should suffice. When you have problems like this - An internal error occurred during: \"Polling news feeds\". javax/xml/bind/JAXBContext - then disable setting Window --> Preferences --> General --> News --> \"Enable automatic news polling\" (may happen when running Eclipse with JDK 11).","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#contributing","text":"","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#table-of-contents","text":"Submitting an Issue Contributing to the Project Contributing to the Code","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#submitting-an-issue","text":"Please read adhere to the following guidelines when submitting new issues.

The sorting top to bottom on this column reflects the priority given by the Product Owner at the time of the Sprint Planning. In Progress: Issues that have been assigned to a contributor and for which work has started. Waiting: Issues for which work has started and that have been put on hold, e.g. because action or feedback by an external contributor is required. Review: Issues that have been resolved, but not been reviewed by another contributor yet. The ticket status is usually Open , but Closed is also allowed if no code change or merge is needed. Testing: Issues that have been reviewed and merged to development branch to be tested and verified on a central TEST instance. The ticket status is supposed to be Closed . Done: Issues that have been resolved, reviewed and satisfy the Definition of Done. The ticket status is supposed to be Closed . The general workflow is that whenever a contributor starts working on an issue, they assign themselves to it and manually move the issue from Backlog to In Progress . Transitions to Waiting and Review also need to be done manually. When the developer is done with all work (no code changes or merges needed, milestone is set), the ticket is supposed to be closed to go automatically to Testing . Approved tickets are supposed to be moved manually from Testing to * Done . The GitHub project has been configured to automatically move issues that are closed to Testing and issues that are reopened back to In Progress .

The translation of SORMAS relies on people from the community. If you would like to see SORMAS translated to your language, please read the points below and take part in the process. How is SORMAS translated? The official SORMAS translation is done using the Crowdin platform: https://crowdin.com/project/sormas All translations done on the platform are automatically fed into SORMAS and are part of the bi-weekly release schedule. This means that any text you translate will likely be part of the next SORMAS release. Once your server (or the server of your country) is updated you will be able to see the translations in the web app and mobile app. How to participate in translating SORMAS You can join the translation project by creating a free account on Crowdin. You can also use your existing GitHub account. Before starting to translate, you need to request write access to the project. A member of the project will either accept your request or get in touch with you as soon as possible. Afterwards open the SORMAS project https://crowdin.com/project/sormas and select the language you would like to translate.

Most of these properties are commented (indicated by a # in front of their name and value) because the default should work for most servers. If you want to change these properties, you can remove the # and specify a valid value. We strongly suggest to add values to the properties that are not commented by default because these are specific to your server (e.g. the default locale/language, the center of the country or region you're using SORMAS in and the URL that leads to the mobile .apk file). Please note that this file contains all the properties that existed in the SORMAS version that you initially installed on your server. We strongly suggest to read the release notes of new versions in order to keep yourself updated about new properties or whether the expected values of existing ones have changed. In any of these cases, you need to manually update the properties file and either insert the new property or change the existing value to one that is compatible. The release notes will give you instructions on how to do this. The following properties are currently configurable: Default locale country.locale : This is the locale your server is using as long as the user has not overwritten it in their settings. It impacts both the language that SORMAS is displayed in as well as e.g. date formats. EPID prefix country.epidprefix : SORMAS automatically generates EPID numbers for new cases. This is the prefix your country is using for all of these numbers. Most of the time it will be some sort of country code and should be three characters long. Country name country.name : Name of the country to pre-fill the country fields for locations and to activate the region, district, etc. fields when this country is selected. Needs to match the name of the country in the database. Country center/zoom country.center.latitude , country.center.longitude and map.zoom : These are the geo coordinates of the geographical center of the country or region you're using SORMAS in. Used to set the initial location of the maps used in dashboards and statistics. App URL app.url : The directory on your server where the mobile .apk file is stored that is used to automatically update the Android app after a new release. You should be able to copy the example given in the properties file and only have to replace the SERVER-NAME placeholder. File paths documents.path , temp.path , generated.path and custom.path : The folders that SORMAS stores files in, either temporarily during case export or permanently like import templates or documents. Files in temp.path are automatically deleted at midnight. Files in custom.path can be used to customize the login page, e.g. to provide default logins for demo servers or add additional contributors to the right sidebar. Automatic case classification feature.automaticcaseclassification : Determines whether SORMAS automatically classifies cases based on a number of criteria that are defined in the code. Email settings email.sender.address and email.sender.name : The email address and sender name that should be used when SORMAS is sending out emails, e.g. to notify users about specific events. SMS settings sms.sender.name, sms.auth.key and sms.auth.secret : Besides emails, SORMAS also supports sending automatic SMS to users at the same time (e.g. when a case has been classified as confirmed). The SMS provider SORMAS is using is the Vonage SMS API ( https://www.vonage.com/communications-apis/sms/ ). If you have an account there, you can use your key and secret here to enable sending out SMS. Leaving these properties empty will disable this feature. CSV separator csv.separator : The separator that CSV files should use to separate columns. This is depending on your server locale. Most systems should be fine using the default ( , ), but e.g. German systems should be set to use ; . Name similarity threshold namesimilaritythreshold : This is used when comparing cases or contacts to find duplicates in the system, either in retrospection or during creation or import. The higher the value, the more restrictive the algorithm, i.e. less potential duplicates will be found. It is suggested to play around with this setting to see which value works for your country and language. Dev mode devmode : Enabling developer mode will give you access to a tab in the Configuration menu that allows admins to create dummy cases and contacts to quickly fill the database. This is only meant to be used on development or demo systems and should be left disabled for production servers. Infrastructure sync threshold infrastructuresyncthreshold : Synchronizing infrastructure data to mobile apps (e.g. regions or health facilities) is done in chunks to avoid connection timeouts. If you expect your users to have very bad internet connection, lowering this threshold could make it easier for them to synchronize this data. Archiving thresholds daysAfterCaseGetsArchived and daysAfterEventGetsArchived : The number of days without any changes after which cases/events are automatically archived (i.e. they will no longer be displayed in the normal directories, but still count towards statistics or counts on the dashboard and can still be viewed by users with the respective user right). If set to 0, automatic archiving is disabled. Rscript executable rscript.executable : The location of the Rscript executable. If you've installed Rscript on your server and specify the path here (the default should work for Linux systems as long as you've used the default install path), network diagrams for transmission chains will be shown in the web app. Symptom journal interface : Properties used to connect to an external symptom journal service. interface.symptomjournal.url is the URL to the website that SORMAS should connect to; interface.symptomjournal.authurl is the URL used to authenticate SORMAS at the external service; interface.symptomjournal.clientid and interface.symptomjournal.secret are the credentials used for the authentication process. A default user can be created automatically at startup by using interface.symptomjournal.defaultuser.username and interface.symptomjournal.defaultuser.password . This user can be used by the Symptom Journal system to connect to SORMAS. Patient diary interface Properties used to connect to an external patient diary service. interface.patientdiary.url is the URL to the website that SORMAS should connect to; interface.patientdiary.probandsurl is the URL to the website that SORMAS can send notifications; interface.patientdiary.authurl is the URL trough which SORMAS can obtain an authorization to the external patient diary; interface.patientdiary.email and interface.patientdiary.password are the credentials used by SORMAS to authenticate in the external patient diary. A default user can be created automatically at startup by using interface.patientdiary.defaultuser.username and interface.patientdiary.defaultuser.password . This user can be used by the Patient Diary system to connect to SORMAS. Custom branding : Properties used to apply a custom branding to SORMAS that overrides its name and default logo. Using these properties also alters the sidebar and adds another customizable area to it. If you want to use this feature, set custombranding to true. custombranding.name is the name that you want to use, custombranding.logo.path is the path to the logo that should be used. Geocoding Properties used to integrate an external geocoding service for obtaining the geo coordinates of addresses. geocodingServiceUrlTemplate is the url for searching for address details, ${street} , ${houseNumber} , ${postalCode} , and ${city} placeholders will be replaced with the actual address fields when searching; geocodingLongitudeJsonPath and geocodingLatitudeJsonPath are used to obtain the longitude and latitude of the address in the result of the geocoding service request Authentication Provider : Allows the user to choose the way of authentication for SORMAS and all it's third party clients. Supported values SORMAS (default) and KEYCLOAK Authentication Provider User Sync At Startup : Enables async user sync when the system boots up. Since the User Sync is mainly needed for an initial sync only, it's recommended to disable/remove this property once an initial sync has be performed. The User Sync will work similarly to the manual user sync: creates all the missing users in the External Authentication Provider updates all existing users in the External Authentication Provider keeps the user's password if the user doesn't exist in the External Authentication Provider will not override the user's password if the user already in the External Authentication Provider (matching done by username case insensitive) will only sync active users (inactive users are automatically synchronized when they are activated manually) is enabled trough a property in sormas.properties authentication.provider.userSyncAtStartup (by default is disabled) Custom login page When setting up the server a custom file directory is created (most likely /opt/sormas/custom ). You can adjust the login*.html files in that directory to customize the login page. Custom download files in about section You can create a sub-folder aboutfiles in the custom directory mentioned above (e.g. /opt/sormas/custom/aboutfiles ). Any file in that directory will be made available in the about section of the frontend. Importing Infrastructure Data When you start a SORMAS server for the first time, some default infrastructure data is generated to ensure that the server is usable and the default users can be created. It is recommended (and, unless you're working on a demo server, necessary) to archive this default data and import the official infrastructure data of the country or part of the country that you intend to use SORMAS in instead. Import SORMAS by default splits infrastructure data into four categories. Starting from the highest administrative division, these are: Regions , Districts , Communities , and Health Facilities . In addition, Points of Entry represent places like harbors and airports where people are frequently entering the country, while Laboratories are technically health facilities that are specifically used for sample testing purposes. To import your data for one of these administrative divisions, log in as the default admin user and open the Configuration menu. Open any of the tabs for the infrastructure data you want to import and click on the Import button on the top right. You can download an import guide from within the popup window that will be opened, containing detailed instructions about the import process and the steps you need to go through in order to successfully import your data. Make sure that you always start with the highest administrative division when importing, i.e. regions, and work your way down to the lowest, because lower divisions typically contain references to higher divisions. Archive After importing your infrastructure data, you need to archive the default data unless you want it to appear in your app. To do that, again open the Configuration menu and the tab for the infrastructure data you want to archive. You can use the text filter on top of the screen to type in the name of the default data, then click on the edit icon to the right, and in the popup window that opens up, click on Archive and confirm your choice. After archiving the default infrastructure data, you might want to edit the default users and assign them to administrative divisions that you've imported. To do so, go to the User menu and click on the edit icon beneath the user you want to re-assign. Disease Configuration SORMAS supports a wide range of diseases, and not all of those might be relevant to any SORMAS instance or might be used in a different context. It is possible to adjust the following variables that define how the different diseases are handled: Whether the disease is active , i.e. it is used in this SORMAS instance Whether the disease is a primary disease, i.e. it is enabled for case surveillance; non-primary diseases can still be used for pathogen testing Whether the disease is case-based ; if not, it is only enabled for aggregate case reporting Whether contact follow-up is enabled The contact follow-up duration Right now, changing these variables unfortunately is not possible from within the user interface, but requires direct database access . If you have this access, you can edit the entries in the diseaseconfiguration table according to your needs. VERY IMPORTANT: Whenever you edit an entry in this table, you also need to manually set the changedate to the current date and time. This is required in order for the mobile app to synchronize the changes and use the edited disease configuration. Feature Configuration Some of the features in SORMAS can be enabled or disabled to further customize the system. Right now, changing these variables unfortunately is not possible from within the user interface, but requires direct database access . If you have this access, you can edit the entries in the featureconfiguration table. There is one entry for every configurable feature in this table, and you can set the value of the enabled column to true to enable it and false to disable it. The region , district , disease and enddate columns are currently only applicable for the line listing feature and define the scope in which line listing is used. Line listing is configurable from within the UI and does not need to be manually edited in the database. VERY IMPORTANT: Whenever you edit an entry in this table, you also need to manually set the changedate to the current date and time. This is required in order for the mobile app to synchronize the changes and use the edited feature configuration. The following features are currently configurable: Case Surveillance CASE_SURVEILANCE : The core module of SORMAS which allows the creation and management of suspect or confirmed disease cases. Contact Tracing CONTACT_TRACING : Management and follow-up of contacts of disease cases. Sample Management SAMPLES_LAB : Management of samples for cases, contacts or event participants and the documentation of pathogen tests performed on these samples. Event Surveillance EVENT_SURVEILLANCE : Creating and managing events and event participants to identify potential outbreaks or disease hotspots. Aggregate Reporting AGGREGATE_REPORTING : Allows collecting case numbers for a number of additional diseases for which case-based surveillance is not used. Commonly referred to as mSers in African countries. Weekly Reporting WEEKLY_REPORTING : Allows mobile users to confirm the number of cases they have collected on a weekly basis and web users to see an overview of whether or not mobile users have submitted their reports and how many cases they have reported. Clinical Management CLINICAL_MANAGEMENT : Enables the clinical management module of cases that allow collecting prescriptions and treatments as well as doctor's visits in a clinical context. National Case Sharing NATIONAL_CASE_SHARING : Allows users with the respective rights to make cases available to the whole country, i.e. other users will see these cases even if they don't belong to their jurisdiction. Task Generation (Case Surveillance) TASK_GENERATION_CASE_SURVEILLANCE : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with case surveillance, especially the Case Investigation tasks that are usually generated when creating a new case. Task Generation (Contact Tracing) TASK_GENERATION_CONTACT_TRACING : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with contact tracing, especially the Contact Investigation tasks that are usually generated when creating a new contact and the Contact Follow-Up tasks that are created once a day for every contact that is under follow-up. Task Generation (Event Surveillance) TASK_GENERATION_EVENT_SURVEILLANCE : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks associated with event surveillance. Task Generation (General) TASK_GENERATION_GENERAL : Enables or disables the automatic generation of tasks that aren't directly associated with one of the three other task types described above, e.g. the Weekly Report Generation task that asks mobile users to submit their weekly reports. Campaigns CAMPAIGNS : The campaigns module allows collecting flexible data which can be customized using the JSON format. Currently this is heavily geared towards vaccination campaigns in Afghanistan, but will be usable in a more generic way in the future for other countries as well. Area Infrastructure INFRASTRUCTURE_TYPE_AREA : Enables an additional infrastructure level above region that is called area by default. Currently only used in the campaigns module. Case Follow-Up CASE_FOLLOWUP : Enables the contact follow-up module for cases as well to allow a more detailed daily documentation of symptoms. Line Listing LINE_LISTING : Whether or not using line listing for case entry is enabled in the specified jurisdiction for the specified disease. Configurable from the UI, no database interaction needed. Documents DOCUMENTS : Enables document storage. GDPR Popup GDPR_CONSENT_POPUP : Enables a popup which informs new users about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union Task related notifications TASK_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables email and SMS notifications related to tasks management Notifications related to confirmed cases of event participants EVENT_PARTICIPANT_CASE_CONFIRMED_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables email and SMS notifications sent to surveillance officers of events when the case of an event participant is confirmed Other notifications OTHER_NOTIFICATIONS : Enables other email and SMS notifications (other than those impacted by TASK_NOTIFICATIONS and EVENT_PARTICIPANT_CASE_CONFIRMED_NOTIFICATIONS ) Proxy Settings Some SORMAS integrations support proxy settings: * Patient diary interface * Geocoding * SORMAS 2 SORMAS The proxy can be configured through the following system properties which can be passed as JVM arguments to the server: * org.jboss.resteasy.jaxrs.client.proxy.host * org.jboss.resteasy.jaxrs.client.proxy.port * org.jboss.resteasy.jaxrs.client.proxy.scheme","title":"Custimization"},{"location":"SERVER_CUSTOMIZATION/#customizing-a-sormas-server","text":"","title":"Customizing a SORMAS Server"},{"location":"SERVER_CUSTOMIZATION/#content","text":"Customizing a SORMAS Server Content Server Configuration Custom login page Custom download files in about section Importing Infrastructure Data Import Archive Disease Configuration Feature Configuration Proxy Settings","title":"Content"},{"location":"SERVER_CUSTOMIZATION/#server-configuration","text":"After installing a SORMAS servers, you can customize various configurations that define how SORMAS operates and is set up.

This will provide a bash emulation that you can use to run the setup script: https://gitforwindows.org/ Unzip the ZIP archive (e.g. into you download directory) Open Git Bash and navigate to the setup sub-directory Post-Installation Configuration Optional: Open server-setup.sh in a text editor to customize the install paths, database access and ports for the server. The default ports are 6080 (HTTP), 6081 (HTTPS) and 6048 (admin). Important: Do not change the name of the database user. The pre-defined name is used in the statements executed in the database. Set up the database and a Payara domain for SORMAS by executing the setup script: sudo -s ./server-setup.sh Press enter whenever asked for it IMPORTANT : Make sure the script executed successfully. If anything goes wrong you need to fix the problem (or ask for help), then delete the created domain directory and re-execute the script. IMPORTANT : Adjust the SORMAS configuration for your country in /opt/domains/sormas/sormas.properties Adjust the logging configuration in /opt/domains/sormas/config/logback.xml based on your needs (e.g. configure and activate email appender) Linux: Update the SORMAS domain Keycloak Server Keycloak can be set up in two ways: * as a Docker container (for just using Keycloak approach) * as a Standalone installation (for doing development in Keycloak like themes, SPIs) Keycloak as a Docker container To be done only in the situation when SORMAS is already installed on the machine as a standalone installation. For complete Docker setup see the SORMAS-Docker repository. Prerequisites * SORMAS Server is installed * PostgreSQL is installed * Docker is installed * Open and edit sormas-base/setup/keycloak/keycloak-setup.sh with your system's actual values (on Windows use Git Bash) . Setup * Run sormas-base/setup/keycloak/keycloak-setup.sh * Update sormas.properties file in the SORMAS domain with the property authentication.provider=KEYCLOAK Keycloak as a standalone installation Prerequisites * SORMAS Server is installed * PostgreSQL is installed Setup Setting Keycloak up as a standalone installation Server Installation and Configuration Guide * Make sure to configure Keycloak with PostgreSQL Database Relational Database Setup * Set up an Admin User * Copy the themes folder content to ${KEYCLOAK_HOME}/themes Deploying Themes * Deploy the sormas-keycloak-service-provider Using Keycloak Deployer * Update the sormas-base/setup/keycloak/SORMAS.json file by replacing the following placeholders: ${SORMAS_SERVER_URL} , ${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_UI_SECRET} , ${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_BACKEND_SECRET} , ${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_REST_SECRET} * Create the SORMAS Realm by importing sormas-base/setup/keycloak/SORMAS.json see Create a New Realm * Update the sormas-* clients by generating new secrets for them * Update the realm's email settings to allow sending emails to users To update the SORMAS Server run the following commands: ${ASADMIN} set-config-property --propertyName=payara.security.openid.clientSecret --propertyValue=${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_UI_SECRET} --source=domain ${ASADMIN} set-config-property --propertyName=payara.security.openid.clientId --propertyValue=sormas-ui --source=domain ${ASADMIN} set-config-property --propertyName=payara.security.openid.scope --propertyValue=openid --source=domain ${ASADMIN} set-config-property --propertyName=payara.security.openid.providerURI --propertyValue=http://localhost:${KEYCLOAK_PORT}/keycloak/auth/realms/SORMAS --source=domain ${ASADMIN} set-config-property --propertyName=sormas.rest.security.oidc.json \\ --propertyValue=\"{\\\"realm\\\":\\\"SORMAS\\\",\\\"auth-server-url\\\":\\\"http://localhost:${KEYCLOAK_PORT}/auth\\\",\\\"ssl-required\\\":\\\"external\\\",\\\"resource\\\":\\\"sormas-rest\\\",\\\"credentials\\\":{\\\"secret\\\":\\\"${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_REST_SECRET}\\\"},\\\"confidential-port\\\":0,\\\"principal-attribute\\\":\\\"preferred_username\\\",\\\"enable-basic-auth\\\":true}\" \\ --source=domain ${ASADMIN} set-config-property --propertyName=sormas.backend.security.oidc.json --propertyValue=\"{\\\"realm\\\":\\\"SORMAS\\\",\\\"auth-server-url\\\":\\\"http://localhost:${KEYCLOAK_PORT}/auth/\\\",\\\"ssl-required\\\":\\\"external\\\",\\\"resource\\\":\\\"sormas-backend\\\",\\\"credentials\\\":{\\\"secret\\\":\\\"${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_BACKEND_SECRET}\\\"},\\\"confidential-port\\\":0}\" --source=domain where: * ${ASADMIN} - represents the location to ${PAYARA_HOME}\\bin\\asadmin * ${KEYCLOAK_PORT} - the port on which keycloak will run * ${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_UI_SECRET} - is the secret generated in Keycloak for the sormas-ui client * ${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_REST_SECRET} - is the secret generated in Keycloak for the sormas-rest client * ${KEYCLOAK_SORMAS_BACKEND_SECRET} - is the secret generated in Keycloak for the sormas-backend client Then update sormas.properties file in the SORMAS domain with the property authentication.provider=KEYCLOAK Connect Keycloak to an already running instance of SORMAS after setting up Keycloak as one of the described options above In case Keycloak is set up alongside an already running instance of SORMAS, these are the steps to follow to make sure already existing users can access the system: 1. Manually create an admin user in Keycloak for the SORMAS realm Creating a user (username has to be the same as admin's username in SORMAS) 2. Login to SORMAS and trigger the Sync Users button from the Users page 3. This will sync users to Keycloak keeping their original password - see SORMAS Keycloak Service Provider for more information about this Keycloak configuration More about the default configuration and how to customize can be found here Keycloak Web Server Setup Apache Web Server Note: This is not necessary for development systems. When you are using SORMAS in a production environment you should use a http server like Apache 2 instead of putting the Payara server in the first line. Here are some things that you should do to configure the Apache server as a proxy: Activate all needed modules: a2enmod ssl a2enmod rewrite a2enmod proxy a2enmod proxy_http a2enmod headers Create a new site /etc/apache2/sites-available/your.sormas.server.url.conf (e.g. sormas.org.conf).

For SORMAS this is port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). In addition you will need the SSH port to access the server for admin purposes. We suggest to use UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) which provides a simple interface to iptables: sudo apt-get install ufw sudo ufw default deny incoming sudo ufw default allow outgoing sudo ufw allow ssh sudo ufw allow http sudo ufw allow https sudo ufw enable Postfix Mail Server Install postfix and mailutils apt install aptitude aptitude install postfix -> choose \"satelite system\" apt install mailutils Configure your system nano /etc/aliases -> add \"root: enter-your@support-email-here.com\" nano /opt/domains/sormas/config/logback.xml -> make sure \"EMAIL_ERROR\" appender is active and sends out to your email address Testing the Server Setup Use SSL Labs to test your server security config: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest R Software Environment In order to enable disease network diagrams in the contact dashboard, R and several extension packages are required. Then the Rscript executable has to be configured in the sormas.properties file. This can be conveniently accomplished by executing the R setup script from the SORMAS ZIP archive (see SORMAS Server ): If the SORMAS installation has been customized, r-setup.sh the install paths may have to be adjusted accordingly with a text editor. Execute R setup script and follow its instructions. chmod +x r-setup.sh ./r-setup.sh SORMAS to SORMAS Certificate Setup To be able to communicate with other SORMAS instances, there are some additional steps which need to be taken, in order to set up the certificate and the truststore. Please see the related guide for detailed instructions regarding SORMAS to SORMAS setup. Troubleshooting Problem: Login fails Check that the users table does have a corresponding entry. If not, the database initialization that is done when deploying sormas-ear.ear probably had an error. Problem: Server is out of memory Old servers were set up with a memory size of less than 2048MB. You can change this using the following commands: /opt/payara-172/glassfish/bin/asadmin --port 6048 delete-jvm-options -Xmx512m /opt/payara-172/glassfish/bin/asadmin --port 6048 delete-jvm-options -Xmx1024m /opt/payara-172/glassfish/bin/asadmin --port 6048 create-jvm-options -Xmx2048m Alternative: You can edit the settings directly in the domain.xml in the config directory of the SORMAS domain. Just search for Xmx - there should be two entries that need to be changed.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"SERVER_SETUP/#installing-a-sormas-server","text":"Note: This guide explains how to set up a SORMAS server on Linux and Windows systems, the latter only being intended for usage on development systems.

Answering all the questions asked in this guide will make sure that we will be able to integrate new diseases into SORMAS as quickly as possible. Content SOP for Adding New Diseases to SORMAS Content Guide Step 1: Download the Data Dictionary Step 2: Define Basic Disease Details Step 3: Define Existing Case Fields Step 4: Define Existing Person Fields Step 5: Define the Relevant Symptoms Step 6: Define the Relevant Epidemiological Data Step 7: Define Health Conditions Step 8: Define New Fields in Other Areas Step 9: Provide Case Classification Criteria Step 10: Provide Additional Information Step 11: Send Your Disease Definition to the SORMAS Team Guide Step 1: Download the Data Dictionary Download the latest Data Dictionary from this repository and open it. Please never use a version of the Data Dictionary that you downloaded earlier as it is very likely that its contents have changed in the meantime. You will use the Data Dictionary to define all the details of the new disease. Please make sure to mark every addition or change (e.g. by colorizing the text or background of the row in a subtle red) so we don't miss any of the information you have provided. Step 2: Define Basic Disease Details Open the Case tab of the Data Dictionary and scroll down to the tables that have a blue background. These tables define enumerations , which are basically data types with fixed values. Examples include the different case classifications, the gender of a person or the diseases that are used in SORMAS. Find the Disease enumeration table (refer to the Type column) and add a new row to it. Enter the following details: The name of the disease in the Caption column Optionally, if the disease has a long name, a short name or abbreviation in the Short column Use the Description column to answer the following question(s): Does the disease have contact follow-up ? If yes, for how many days should contact follow-up be done? Step 3: Define Existing Case Fields Look through the rows in the first table of the Case tab (which has a grey background). This table defines all the fields that are displayed in the Case Information tab in the SORMAS application. The Caption column defines the name of the field as it is displayed in the user interface, while the Diseases column specifies which diseases use this field. Please add the name (or, if available, short name) of your new disease to the \"New disease\" column of every row that represents a field that is relevant for it and colorize it. Step 4: Define Existing Person Fields Open the Person tab and repeat step 3 for the first table containing the fields that define the details of a person in SORMAS. Step 5: Define the Relevant Symptoms Open the Symptoms tab which lists all the symptoms that are currently used in SORMAS. This is a very long list and you will have to go through every single row and define whether this symptom should be tracked for your new disease or not. It's possible that your new disease uses one or more symptoms that are currently not part of SORMAS. In that case, you need to add a new row for each of these symptoms to the bottom of the table and provide the name of the symptom in the Caption column. Most symptoms in SORMAS are simple Yes/No/Unknown fields where Yes means that the symptom is present, No that the symptom is not present and Unknown that there is no information about whether the symptom is present or not. If your symptom can simply be defined by this pattern, you don't have to specify anything else. However, if your symptom is more complex (e.g. there are a number of pre-defined values that the user should choose from), please provide all the necessary details about how the symptom should be specified by users in the Description column. Step 6: Define the Relevant Epidemiological Data Open the Epidemiological data tab which lists all fields that are used to collect information about the epidemiological background of the case, e.g. whether they visited burials, had contact with a confirmed case or animals. Repeat step 3 for all rows in the first table, and add new rows if your new disease requires information that is not currently collected within SORMAS. As new fields in this tab are likely to be more complex than basic symptoms, make sure to define as much information about how they should function in the Description column. Step 7: Define Health Conditions Open the Health conditions tab which contains a list of pre-existing conditions that are not symptoms of the disease, but are still relevant especially for case management purposes in a hospital. Repeat step 3 for all rows in the first table, and add new rows if there are health conditions relevant for your new disease that are not part of SORMAS yet. As always with new fields, make sure to provide all relevant details in the Description column. Step 8: Define New Fields in Other Areas It is possible that your disease requires further information to be collected that is not supported by SORMAS yet, e.g. new details about the person, specific information about its hospitalization, or even very important fields that should directly go into the case information. You can use the same process you used to define new symptoms, health conditions or epidemiological data fields by opening the tab in question and adding new rows to the topmost table. At this point, you have finished all the necessary definitions in the Data Dictionary. Save your work and prepare an email with the Data Dictionary file attached to it. Don't send this email before working through the remaining steps though, as there are still a few details that are needed in order to finish the specification of your new disease. Step 9: Provide Case Classification Criteria Optimally, when defining a new disease, you should also specify the criteria SORMAS should use to automatically classify the case as suspect, probable or confirmed. In order to do this in a way that is compatible with the system we use, you will need access to a running SORMAS system (e.g. the play server you can find at https://sormas.org ). Log in as any user (e.g. the default user on the play server), open the About section from the main menu, and open the Case Classification Rules (HTML) document. Please define the classification criteria in a way that is similar to the system used in this document. If available, you can also send us an official document by WHO or your national CDC that specifies the classification criteria. Step 10: Provide Additional Information If there are still things that are necessary in order to properly implement the new disease in SORMAS (you might require us to create a whole new area for cases or there might be very complex mechanics that need a lot more specification), please give us as many details about them as possible. Just put all this information into your email. Step 11: Send Your Disease Definition to the SORMAS Team Send your email containing the updated Data Dictionary file, the case classification criteria and your additional notes to sormas@helmholtz-hzi.de. Congratulations, your work is done! We should now have all the information we need in order to integrate your disease into SORMAS. If there is anything that is unclear or if we need additional details, we will get in touch with you as soon as possible.

Configuration summary Login & Authentication Duplicate emails are allowed in order to support the same requirement as SORMAS which in some installations require admin support for some users, in which case the admin will use her own email address No login with emails due to the previous point Password Policy comes predefined since version 1.54 of the SORMAS-Project with the following default settings Length of minimum 12 characters At least 1 upper case letter At least 1 lower case letter At least 1 digit At least 1 special character OTP is supported by default trough the Google Authenticator or Free OTP by has to be activated from the Keycloak Admin console Forgot Password is enabled by default sormas-sha256 is an encryption algorithm which comes packaged with Keycloak to support transition of existing environments towards the Keycloak Authentication Provider Clients The SORMAS Realm relies on 4 clients: sormas-ui - handles access to the SORMAS wen UI sormas-app - handles access to the SORMAS Android App sormas-rest - handles access to the SORMAS API sormas-backend - handles SORMAS server requests Roles The role management is handled by SORMAS however as a pre-validation Keycloak is also configured with a few roles which are required for certain API access: * USER - required by default for any API access * REST_USER - required for most API endpoints (main purpose is for the SurvNet converter) * REST_EXTERNAL_VISITS_USER - required by Symptom Journals which are connected to SORMAS * SORMAS_TO_SORMAS_CLIENT - required by other SORMAS instance to access the current SORMAS instance Email Email configurations are optional and are not part of the default configuration. In case the system relies on users activating their own accounts it's required to configure these settings. Custom Configuration The configuration provided by default is the minimum required configuration for Keycloak to work together with SORMAS. The Keycloak configuration can be adjusted by any user with admin rights, however beware that any change to the default configuration might render the system unusable. The following configurations are most likely to be environment specific: Email Settings make sure to set an email for the admin user, so the Test connection feature works Password Policies The Password Blacklist policy can only be configured with access to the host machine OTP Policies Can be activated by default for all user by marking Basic Auth Password+OTP as required in the Authentication>Flows section, then mark it as default in the Authentication>Required section","title":"Keycloak"},{"location":"sormas-base/doc/keycloak/#keycloak","text":"Open Source Identity and Access Management.

The server installation is located in the project build directory ( target/cargo ), as well as the SORMAS server directories ( target/sormasfolders ). Prerequisites This setup requires a working Java, maven, and docker(-compose) environment. Configuration The configuration of the docker setup and the payara domain setup are defined by the generated file .env . It configures port and server of the sormas-postgres docker container or another postgres database, as well as other ports defined in the domain.xml . Properties used in the payara deployment are configured in the generated file target/sormas.properties . Both .env and sormas.properties can be customized by adding a file custom.env respectively custom.properties in the project base directory, where additional properties for the respective purpose are defined. Already defined properties are overwritten. Both custom.env and custom.properties are excluded in .gitignore , so local customizations are protected from accidental commits. To run the cargo server against an existing database, configure SORMAS_POSTGRES_SERVER=<database-server> SORMAS_POSTGRES_PORT=<database-port> in file custom.env and skip the docker-compose step in the server setup (see file custom.env.example ). To add properties to the generated sormas.properties , configure e.g. custombranding=true custombranding.name=<name> custombranding.logo.path=<logopath> in file custom.properties (see file custom.properties.example ). After adjusting the configurations, (re)run mvn install and (re)start the server.
